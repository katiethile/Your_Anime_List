## Your Anime List

This sinatra application will let user create their own list of animes being watched, completed, on-hold, dropped, and currently watching. It will also let user give their own rating of 1-10. If, later on, they wanted to edit/change their watch status and rating of the anime or even edit the anime name (in case there was a spelling error), they will be able to edit the changes and update it. Deleting an anime they create is also possible. User will only be able to view their own animes and make changes to their own anime. 

## Installation 

1. Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/katiethile/Your_Anime_List)
2. cd into Your_Anime and repeat that step (I'm not sure why my application made it so I would have to cd twice)
3. And then execute $ `bundle`

## Usage 

1. After bundling, run shotgun and click on the link to go to the web browser 
2. Sign up to create an account
3. After signing up, user will be redirected to their account/profile page, which will be the index page, that will show all animes user has watched. 
4. User will be able to create a new anime by clicking on the new anime link on that page, and setting a name, watch status and rating of 1-10. 
5. User will also be able to edit the changes made later on if they feel like doing so, and also be able to delete the anime created. 
6. User will only be able to view and edit their own animes and not other users'.
